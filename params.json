It should be easy to get something up and running. \r\n\r\nBy convention the configuration file must be named .jtmux.json - jtmux will traverse up the path until it finds one, or hits root. In the latter case the default configuration is used in stead.\r\n\r\nCheckout out the lib/jtmux/defaultConfiguration.json file for an idea as to how it works.\r\n\r\n###Run jtmux\r\njtmux will either attach you to the existing session - or create a new one, with the windows you have specified in your configuration file. \r\n","tagline":"Javascript tmux configuration manager","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
